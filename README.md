[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) is a lightweight and dynamic window manager designed for X11, emphasizing simplicity and efficiency. Following the tiling window manager paradigm, it dynamically arranges windows to make the most of screen real estate. In my setup, I've chosen to stick to a no-patches philosophy, aiming to keep the core codebase clean and stable. This approach encourages hands-on customization of the source code, allowing for a unique and tailored experience. If you'd like to replicate this setup, you can clone the repository, tweak the config.h file to match your preferences, compile, and install dwm. The absence of official patches provides room for direct customization, resulting in a fast, stable, and highly personalized window management environment that aligns with aesthetic and functional preferences.

## Hint: I have encorporated a auto-install script for newly installed arch systems for simplicity :)
